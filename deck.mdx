## Part 1: Before coding

## Repository Structure
<br/>

|Category|Samples|Usage|
|----|------|-----|
|Source Code|/src|contain the source codes or tests|
|Documents|/docs<br/>\*.rst; \*.md|docs folder or markdown/reStructuredText for documents|
|Other functional files|git config files<br/>CI\* config files(appveyor,travis,circle)<br/>package dependency(package.json,requirement.txt)<br/>...|For extended requirements & advanced features|
|Scripts|init<br/>build<br/>|including some script for us to execute for environment preparing. Save time from duplicate typing|     

- All of them required?
- Why not put source code out side?

```notes
1. Not all required. Former more important.
2. Control the growth of code

```

## IDE vs CLI    
<br/>   

|Tools|Pros|Cons|
|------|---|---|
|**IDE**|1. Easy to use<br/>2. Clear with UI <br/>3. Plugins |1. Ignore a lot of details<br/>2. Unstable|
|**CLI**|1. Make users understand the details<br/>2. Developer friendly |1. Not intuitive <br/>2. Cost time to learn|

###### \*IDE: *I*ntegrated *D*evelopment *E*nvironment<br/>\*CLI: *C*ommand *L*ine *I*nterface

```notes
IDE: UI with mouse to provide a lot of easy access. Detail is ignored so the folder project structure is ignored.
CLI: Key board access could be much more easier than click the mouse/switch between
```
