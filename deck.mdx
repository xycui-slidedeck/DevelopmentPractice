## Methodology & Practice in (.NET) Development.

```notes
1. Maybe Guideline is a better name. But the scope is too large. 
2. Some tips to avoid issue. Some tools & concept to introduce. Will not covered if xiaoice is not using. Will not envolve design patterns.
3. From a different perspective to introduce

## Part 1: Before coding

## *Code* Repository
### What is the structure? 
<br/>

|Category|Samples|Usage|
|----|------|-----|
|Source Code|/src|contain the source codes or tests|
|Documents|/docs<br/>\*.rst; \*.md|docs folder or markdown/reStructuredText for documents|
|Other functional files|git config files<br/>CI\* config files(appveyor,travis,circle)<br/>package dependency(package.json,requirement.txt)<br/>...|For extended requirements & advanced features|
|Scripts|init<br/>build<br/>|including some script for us to execute for environment preparing. Save time from duplicate typing|     

- All of them required?
- Why not put source code out side?

```notes
1. Not all required. Former more important.
2. Control the growth of code

```

## Repository Sample
![Newtonjson](.\images\structure_newtonjson_note.png "Newtonjson") ![NetStandard](.\images\structure_netstandard.png "NetStandard")     
###### - NewtonJson: https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json<br/>- Pyinstaller: https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller<br/>- NetCore(multiple Readme): https://github.com/dotnet/core

```notes
Net core *
```

## Projects
### What is in project?   

|Items|Note|
|----|----|
|**Source code**|-|
|**Config/resource file**|Avoid put dependency like .dll/.jar except native|
|**Dependency/Description file**|.csproj/.vcxproj in .NET, pom.xml/build.gradle in Java, |   
<br/>   

### Types of projects?
![Project type](.\images\project_type.png "Project type")    
### Project Target & Runtime Identifier(.NET)?
##### Target: NetFramework/NetCore/[NetStandard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard "NetStandard")

## Takeaway
#### 1. Create/Reuse library/project depends on requirement. 
#### 2. Concept of interface   
##### - Large scale system: Interface project for behaviour reusing.   
##### - Standalone service: Interface & implement in same library/project.   
#### 3. App is just a wrapper for interactive. 
#### 4. Web is also a kind of Console -- Do more Self-host(Owin, Kestrel, Flask) 
#### 5. Project as a service.
#### 6. Jump out of the sln concept for .NET development

```notes
1. Util is a class should not become a project. Avoid fragment of projects.
2. Focus on folder. solution is just for visualize the relationship. (Build setting)

```

## Clean Environment
1. Build environment - Docker
2. Package dependency - NuGet.Config
3. Resource file dependency -

## Part 3: Other thinking

## IDE vs CLI    
<br/>   

|Tools|Pros|Cons|
|------|---|---|
|**IDE**|1. Easy to use<br/>2. Clear with UI <br/>3. Plugins |1. Ignore a lot of details<br/>2. Unstable|
|**CLI**|1. Make users understand the details<br/>2. Developer friendly |1. Not intuitive <br/>2. Cost time to learn|

###### \*IDE: *I*ntegrated *D*evelopment *E*nvironment<br/>\*CLI: *C*ommand *L*ine *I*nterface

```notes
IDE: UI with mouse to provide a lot of easy access. Detail is ignored so the folder project structure is ignored.
CLI: Key board access could be much more easier than click the mouse/switch between
```

## Summary
Use more 'vs' when searching
